- **React `^18.3.1`**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Vitest**: Used for testing. Vitest is a modern testing framework built for Vite.
- **Vite**: A next-generation, fast build tool for modern web applications.
- **CSS 3**: Styles for the application.
- **JavaScript**: The primary language for logic and functionality.
- **Netlify**: Used for deploying the app

## Vite Configuration

This project uses **Vite** as the build tool. Vite provides an ultra-fast development environment and optimized production builds. Here are some highlights of how Vite is used in this project:

- **Development Server**: Vite's development server provides fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement), enabling a smooth and fast development experience.
- **Optimized Builds**: Vite optimizes the application for production using features like tree-shaking, lazy-loading, and ES module support.
- **Typescript Support**: Vite natively supports TypeScript, so you donâ€™t need to configure additional TypeScript tooling.
  
To learn more about Vite and how to configure it further, check out the [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Search for movies by title using the OMDB API.
- **Movie Details**: View detailed information about movies, including title, release year, plot, actors, and more.
- **Rating System**: Users can rate movies on a 1-0 scale.
- **Watch List**: Add movies to a watched list.
- **Remove from Watch List**: Easily remove movies from the watched list.
- **Local Storage**: Movies in the watched list are saved to the browser's local storage to persist data between sessions.

## API

The application uses the OMDB API to fetch movie data. You can view the API documentation [here](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

### Example API request

```http
GET https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&s=movieName
```

Replace `movieName` with the desired movie name, and `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.
